# myriad-buildscripts
Set of build scripts to install BLIC's software on UCL Myriad HPC.

These are meant to be installed under /shared/ucl/depts/cancer/modulefiles/

At the moment we are simply installing all the module files directly under that directory.
This might change in the future if we need to avoid possible clashes with centrally supported
software or if the number of packages is so large that a plain organisation is not
appropriate any longer.
